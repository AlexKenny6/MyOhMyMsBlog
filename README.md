# MyOhMyMsBlog
Code files for www.myohmymsblog.me The blog I created for the Seattle Mariners baseball organization.

These are the files for my blog, I created this blog because I love the Seattle Mariners and I love to code. 
Why not combine both of these into one thing? 
So the blog was born in Winter 2017.
